# My JSON Resume

This is my CV/resume in the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) format.

## About JSON Resume

[JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) is an open-source initiative to create a JSON-based standard for resumes. Instead of maintaining multiple resume formats, you maintain one canonical JSON file that can be:

- 🎨 **Themed** - Choose from hundreds of beautiful themes or create your own
- 🔄 **Portable** - One format works everywhere
- 🤖 **Parseable** - Easy for tools and applications to read
- 📱 **Responsive** - Themes work on any device
- 🌐 **Shareable** - Host your resume with a simple URL

The standard makes it easy to keep your resume up-to-date and share it in different formats without manually recreating it each time.
